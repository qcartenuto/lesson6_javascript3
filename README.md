### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Document Object Model(DOM): Docment Object Model or DOM is the structure of an HTML document/webpage. Shown in a tree digram. With each element, tag, and attribute of the document being represented as nodes.  Starting at the root node and working its way down through parent nodes, child/sibling nodes; all the way to leaf nodes.
2. Node: Nodes (as the previous list item mentions) are the elements, attributes, and tags of an HTML's DOM. Each node is part of the DOM's tree. These nodes are accessed and traversed through JavaScript and/or the HTML document itself.
3. Event Handlers: Event Handlers are code blocks in JavaScript that fire off when an event is called, such as 'onclick', 'onmouseover', etc. When an event is called the event handler will fire off a function(s) that was passed in as a parameter or arguement of the handler or one that was prerendered, such as a jQuery library script.
